# Full-Stack-Web-Development

This is some of my capstone and other projects that I worked on in while working my way through Full-Stack Web Development. 

Please note that these are my projects and while they may be used for reference, please do not copy as there may be personal or references not appropriate for re-use. Anything in this repository is available to be used as an example at developers discretion.

Please be kind regarding these projects. I know some of these are simple. I started with the basics. Some may still be works in progress. As we learn more we change and grow and add more to it. Feel free to take or leave what you will. I hope your journey is great and full of fun. Remember, we do this because we love it!
